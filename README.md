# ðŸŸ¢Wacanda Flow

**Wacanda Flow** is a web application that immerses users in a dynamic, animated atmosphere where every scroll becomes part of the story. Powered by the [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) animation library and its [ScrollTrigger](https://gsap.com/scrolltrigger/) plugin, we synchronize scroll behavior with smooth animations to create an engaging, interactive experience.
